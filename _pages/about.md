Hi! I'm a sophomore at Stanford University ðŸŒ² studying Math and CS. 

My interests are diverse, currently, I'm exploring the space of autonomous systems and decision-making in out-of-distribution situations as a member of [Stanford ASL](https://stanfordasl.github.io/). I previously worked in computational drug discovery research ðŸ’Š (where I was a member of the [Ron Dror Group](https://drorlab.stanford.edu/)) and was also interested in Agent-based reasoning in NLP ðŸ¤–. 
 
In my freetime, I sing acapella ðŸŽµ for the [Stanford Mendicants](https://stanfordmendicants.com/) where I sing the tenor/lead parts. I also love to fence ðŸ¤º: I  fence foil.

Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat/connect at alexw17 at stanford dot edu. I am always happy to chat!
