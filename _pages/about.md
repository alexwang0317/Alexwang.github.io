Hi! I'm a sophomore student at Stanford University 🌲 studying Math and CS. 

My interests are diverse, spanning from computational drug discovery research 💊 (where I am a member of the [Ron Dror Group](https://drorlab.stanford.edu/)) to NLP 🤖 to building hardware/software. 
 
In my freetime, I sing acapella 🎵 for the [Stanford Mendicants](https://stanfordmendicants.com/) where we sing the tenor/lead parts. I also love to fence 🤺 where I specifically fence foil and run 🏃 (a new strava enthusiast).

Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat/connect at alexw17 at stanford dot edu. I am always happy to chat!
