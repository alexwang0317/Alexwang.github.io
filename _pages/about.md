Hi! I'm a junior at Stanford University ðŸŒ² studying Math and CS. 

I was an intern at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/about/) working on their disaster recovery team, building internal tooling to profile/track large-scale system failures. I've worked on exploring the space of autonomous systems and decision-making in out-of-distribution situations as a member of [Stanford ASL](https://stanfordasl.github.io/). I've also previously worked in computational drug discovery research ðŸ’Š (where I was a member of the [Ron Dror Group](https://drorlab.stanford.edu/)) and also worked on interested in multi-agent collaboration for a trading startupðŸ¤–. I also enjoyed a brief stint in [organometallic catalysis research](https://www.mdpi.com/2624-8549/4/2/29). 
 
In my freetime, I sing acapella ðŸŽµ with the [Stanford Mendicants](https://stanfordmendicants.com/) where I sing tenor and play guitar. 

Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat/connect at alexw17 at stanford dot edu. I am always happy to chat!
