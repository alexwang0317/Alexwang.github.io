Hi! I'm a sophomore at Stanford University ðŸŒ² studying Math and CS. 

My interests are diverse, spanning from computational drug discovery research ðŸ’Š (where I am a member of the [Ron Dror Group](https://drorlab.stanford.edu/)) to NLP ðŸ¤– to building hardware/software. 
 
In my freetime, I sing acapella ðŸŽµ for the [Stanford Mendicants](https://stanfordmendicants.com/) where I sing the tenor/lead parts. I also love to fence ðŸ¤º: I  fence foil.

Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat/connect at alexw17 at stanford dot edu. I am always happy to chat!
