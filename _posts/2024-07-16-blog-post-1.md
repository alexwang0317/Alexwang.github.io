Hi! I just setup this website and I will be posting in the near future about different things that I work on, some current ideas are as follows:
1. My based takes on various philosophers presented in "The History of Western Philosophy" by Bertrand Russell.
2. Progress in my drone-adventure + learning full-stack skills. 
3. Reflection on Stanford and future challenges.
4. Book recommendations/reviews (What I recommended to friends!).
